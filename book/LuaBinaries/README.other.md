Other Libraries Downloads
-------------------------

Here you will find packages for other UNIX systems than Linux. Each package contains
pre-compiled binaries for the specified platform.

Libraries packages for UNIX contain dynamic libraries (*.so), 
static libraries (*.a), and include files (*.h). So they contain
run time and development files together in the same package.

Libraries are in the root of the package, and include files
are inside an "include" folder.
